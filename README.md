# kanji
I will be posting five new characters that I learn each night from Remembering The Kanji, Part 1 (verison 3).

- **kanji.txt** contains each character on a new line, followed by a space, and a key-word, possibly separated by forward slashes if there are more key-words. The line number corresponds to the key-word index in the textbook.
- **kanji.day.txt** contains five characters per line
- **kanji.min.txt** contains every character on a single line with no separation
