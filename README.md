# kanji
I will be posting five new characters that I learn from Remembering The Kanji, Part 1 (verison 3).

kanji.txt consists of each character on a new line, where the line number cooresponds to the key-word in the textbook.

kanji.min.txt contains every character on a single line, with no separation.
